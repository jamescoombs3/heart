# heart
"A data driven method to define the heart of a school's community."

In England, secondary 'Academy' schools get state funding on the strict basis that they are "at the heart of the community" ... but this isn't defined. 
There is a longer description here https://trak.org.uk/mind-the-gap which proposes a method to base 'community' on the neighbouring primary schools weighted by size and the inverse square of distance. 
This repository contains two Python scripts. 
The first processes the official government data to work out the proportion of deprived children (those receiving free school meals) in the "heart of the community" and those in each of the 3000+ schools. 
The second plots a few graphs which just scratch the surface of what could be done with this method. 

The data from the Department for Education and the Office for National statistics used is included as are details of where to find updated releases (as long as they don't change too much!)
